A fledgling effort by a small group of New Jersey journalists to scrape, compile and publish monthly crime data in the Garden State.

In the initial phase, we'll publish Ruby scripts to convert the monthly State Police crime data from PDF into csvs for each police agency in the state.

Later, we plan to launch a web interface and API serving slices of the crime data. Ultimately, depending on the time it takes for the second phase, we hope to create a dashboard of visualizations for the data as well.
