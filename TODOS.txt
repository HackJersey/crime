write a script. read in two csvs. for everything missing from 2, add it. Then join that with LEAR and LEAIC

dump and then
reload initial_fixture.json on prod

rewrite fetcher to not download the file locally. it chokes on heroku for some reason (there's no downloads dir in the repo?)

update README docs for endusers, not just admins

add CONTRIBUTING?

flesh out our api docs

write a management command or fabfile to sync production data and repopulate local (copy dumpdata settings from knell)

LAUNCH - ie - send to Steve & Carla & Eric & Grant for feedback

next step in data pipeline: update parser to handle quarterly files and different formats.

convert all to csvs so we offer PDFs and csvs. then move to process each csv into agency data


FUTURE
add these to github
- include in compare_urls email a url that if I hit it, it will run the task to upload the dB and send s success confirmation email. or after a few weeks of testing, just have it auto run fetcher

Admin page with button to run fetcher with a calendar widget to pick date. 
Or optionally change file name or url

port changes to the command line version...?
