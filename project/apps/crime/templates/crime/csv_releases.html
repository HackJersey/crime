{% block intro %}
<h2>CSVs of releases from the New Jersey State Police</h2>
<p>Once we have the PDFs, we next will convert them into CSVs, with files for each of the hundreds of pages and police agencies in each release. The resulting files will be available not only in this list here, but also from our <a href="/crime/api/">API</a> in both JSON and CSV formats.</p>
